# Extensible Markov Model for Modelling Temporal Relationships Between Clusters

Implements TRACDS (Temporal Relationships 
    between Clusters for Data Streams), a generalization of 
    Extensible Markov Model (EMM). TRACDS adds a temporal or order model
    to data stream clustering by superimposing a dynamically adapting
    Markov Chain. Also provides an implementation of EMM (TRACDS on top of tNN 
    data stream clustering).
